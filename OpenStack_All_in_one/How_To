    * password - password
4. Go to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 using 'vim' and check the HW ID
5. Edit virtual box adapter HW ID as it is stated in step number 4. (as for now it's 08:00:27:40:B6:17)
6. Restart the VM (halt)
7. Login once again and check the IP using ifconfig -a
8. Go to your browser and enter the IP address 'http://x.x.x.x/dashboard/' and use the following credentials :
